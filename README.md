# pico-8-nine
A linkable place where I can put my PICO-8 experiments.

I've learned a lot from [Lazy Devs](https://www.youtube.com/c/LazyDevs) and [Nerdy Teachers](https://nerdyteachers.com/).

This repository is heavily inspired by [NangiDev's repository](https://github.com/NangiDev/pico-8-projects)

## Roguelike

[My roguelike](./carts/ytroguelike.p8) heavily based on [Lazy Devs' roguelike tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3LL7J1Q9b6PJua0A-96uUS). So far I've tweaked things here and there and added my own music.

## Dot Roguelike

[Another roguelike of mine](./carts/dotroguelike.p8), if I can even call it that at this stage. Very little right now. Just proof of concept.
